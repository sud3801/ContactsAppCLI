# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sud3801/ContactsAppCLI.git
cd ContactsAppCLI
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```bash
# Using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Build and run your app

With Metro running, open a new terminal window/pane from the root of your React Native project, and use one of the following commands to build and run your Android or iOS app:

### Android

```bash
# Using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### iOS

For iOS, remember to install CocoaPods dependencies (this only needs to be run on first clone or after updating native deps).

The first time you create a new project, run the Ruby bundler to install CocoaPods itself:

```bash
bundle install
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```bash
bundle exec pod install
```

For more information, please visit [CocoaPods Getting Started guide](https://guides.cocoapods.org/using/getting-started.html).

```bash
# Using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device with the beautiful new v1.1 interface!

This is one way to run your app — you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.

## Step 3: Explore the New UI

The v1.1 update brings significant visual improvements:

1. **Launch the app** to see the new loading screen
2. **Browse contacts** with the new card-based design
3. **Try the search** with the enhanced search bar
4. **Pull down** to refresh the contact list
5. **Notice the avatars** that are automatically generated for each contact
